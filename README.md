This is a short exercise in implementing a simple class in Python.

Running the script will produce a plot of 5 random-parameter polar 'flowers', 
generated by the PolarFlower class. These are a subtype of cardioid function:
see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardioid for more on the mathematical 
definition of a cardioid.

(It would be cool to modify this to produce hypo/epitrochoids instead,
i.e. spirographs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph)

Attributes of the class are:\n
self.name: the name of the object \n
self.size: diameter of the cardioid to generate \n
self.petals: the number of 'petals' in the cardioid \n
self.tilt: tilt angle of the object axis (in radians) relative to 0 \n

Methods are:\n
self.thetavals(): Returns a NumPy array of values for theta, from 0 
to 2pi radians.\n
self.rvals(): Returns a NumPy array of radius values for the cardioid\n
object, using the theta value array and attributes.\n

Enjoy!
